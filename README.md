# Pharmacogenomics/Pharmacogenetics

## Introduction
The idea behind this project is to develop a bioinformatics tool designed to aid the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. This tool will build on the resources on the CPIC and PharmVar websites and create a computational tool to read in raw next-gen sequencing data (BAM files) and eventually return CPIC recommendations for clinically-relevant actions based on variants in the pharmacogenes. I anticipate that this tool will be used in clinical electronic health records as a 

Note, this tool is in a development phase. The code here may not actually be the most up-to-date and in its current state it is not ready for clinical implementation. Feel free to use the code to build on your own projects.

As of August, 2019, this project is under active development at the University of Montana Precision Medicine Project. 

## Code
Currently, this project is all written in Python 3.6. However, I'm toying on bringing in other languages if I need to, so I can solve some particular problems. 

When this project becomes more complete, I will include a formal list of libraries and dependencies, but with the code changing, it just doesn't make sense right now to update dependecies.

## Sample Usage
I will update this when the code is complete.
