The idea behind this project is to develop a bioinformatics tool designed to aid the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. 

Currently, this tool is in early development and is in no way ready for clinical implementation or recommended for anything beyond development.

As of June, 2019, this project is under active development at the University of Montana Precision Medicine Project.
